Introduction:
This competition is about trying to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
Starting from dataset understanding, up until machine learning model training and evaluation.

Data Description:
Dataset Summary - Titanic passenger details, including a column if the survived passenger survived or not.
Index Column (Instance of what we want to predict for) - PassengerId.
Target Column (What we want to predict for each element in Index Column) - Survived.
Features - Remaining Columns.

Tasks:
Our target is to learn the "t" function.
This case is about binary classification (Survived or not), therefore it will be performed by using "Logistic Regression".
After the learning process, a new data will be tested with our model to determine who's going to be survived and who isn't.
